## We are team blushing-hawk, and our team is TheLady and lisabronwyn.

###Our goal is #14 GitBook for Notes/Tips/References

The first challenging aspect of our project was that neither one of us had selected the goal this week. We also have never worked together, so in addition to the newness of our team, we had to collaborate immediately in order to proceed quickly.

James was very helpful during our first coaching session of the week. He offered insights regarding existing GitBooks. We perused Ethanâ€™s GitBook, and it was easier to understand formatting and content. 

Di was very interested in strengthening her database muscles, and I had selected ToDo List as my first choice for this week.

We compromised and were able to communicate our needs and requirements for this week.

We were occupied with many tutorials! We used Team Treehouse, Front End Masters and more and will link these in the Resources section.
